<h1>Shopping Cart</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This was a fairly complex exercise. We went through a reducer, context and some regular React hooks. The exercise was a shopping cart and it had features to include a product, product items, read, update, delete item/s and updating the shopping cart logo which showcases the total amount of cart items.

The reducer seems to be repetitive as it goes through conditional statements which are the dispatch types. When evaluated then you can create logic if needed and you can take in any payload that might be passed down. The reducer is the final step when all is said and done. It will set the state along with any other logic that will render to the user. It would appear that this would be the place where data would get sent back and forth between the backend. Otherwise, it would be done with the context API.
