<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
In this exercise a few more React lessons were learned. Apart from the standard setup and typical workflow that has been established, a few treats were added along the way. 
</p>
<p>
The first treat was adding the values.js package. This is a package that will work with colors and their different shades. In our case, we entered a hexidecimal value for the color and the values.js package took in that value and we were able to display an array of shades. This was pretty fun!
</p>
<p>
Apart from the inline, dynamic classes that can be changed depending on the state, in this exercise we styled each box with an inline feature. When doing this you need to add two sets of curly brackets in order for React to understand that it is a style. Also, when writing the styles inline then you will want to use the object syntax as oppose to the traditional css syntax.
</p>

The third treat was going back to vanilla Javascript in using the navigator method with the accompanying clipboard method. This allows the user to copy text or values to the clipboard for later use.
