<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This react tutorial was a tour guide site for users to select a tour of their choosing. The app used the useState and useEffect hooks. There were conditional rendering depending on the status of the state. It also pulled data from an external API that stored the tour data. Finally, there is a prop drill down for the button on each tour. Eventually, this could be replaced by using the context hook or the reducer hook.

Apart from the React coding, there was also a little treat. In the past, I experimented with loading animations. In this application, there is a loading animation that can be seen while the fetch API retrieves the data.
