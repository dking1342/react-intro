<h1>Accordian</h1>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
In this exercise more React concepts were established and previous lessons were reviewed. The concept of using state in the form of a boolean to show or hide a piece of state was used again. In this case it was used to showcase an accordian styled information card. By clicking on the toggle button the state would toggle between the boolean values and subsequently show or hide the information contained in each accordian section.

Another feature that was reiterated in this exercise was the use of react-icons. The plus and minus icons were used within the button.
