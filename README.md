<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
In this exercise, we made what is essentially a todo list. The features of this exercise is the making of an alert that will show when the user makes changes, editing an item, removing an item and creating a new item.
</p>
<p>
The UI is set to begin with no list at all unless there is data that persists in the local storage. Otherwise, the only time the UI will be large enough to show the list is when there is list state.
