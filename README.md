In this exercise there were a number of moving parts. There were more components in this tutorial along with more functionality. To start, there was a difference in functionality and navigation on smaller screens as opposed to larger screens. As is often the case, the menu for navigating on smaller screens was condensed to facilitate the full display of the screen when not navigating. The larger screen render had a typical navigation bar located on the top of the window.

As for React lessons, it was more about adding all the hooks, techniques and lessons from previous exercises. There were times the useState, useEffect, useRef and useContext hooks were used. These were studied more in isolation rather than accompanying each other. This leads to more complexity in managing each hook and how they interact with the component and the other hooks. A bit of regular Javascript was used as well. However, the key, as often has been the case, was with the CSS. The relationship between conditional statements in the components and the way it interacts with the styling gives the exerice different looks for the user and UI. By combining all these aspects, a more robust and user friendly application can be made.
