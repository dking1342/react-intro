<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This React tutorial had many essential React learning lessons. It started out as a simple component that showed a JSX element all the way to multiple components within a tree structure that was updating the props and state for each. The folders within the component subfolder document the steps taken to get from step one to the final step. The final step is a simple example of how React can display a shopping cart. The navbar displays the total number of items being purchased, the subheader navbar can reset your shopping cart and sort the items and finally there is a list of items in your shopping cart with the opportunity to add, decrease or delete the item or quantity of that item.
