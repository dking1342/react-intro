<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is a simple project working with the react-router-dom package. This project takes from the react-router-dom package such as Route, Link, etc. to create a dynamic application which can traverse different routes. The application also makes use of the JSON Typicode API where posts are called. The preliminary posts are listed and when clicked on then more information appears in the next view.
