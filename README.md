<h1>Movies App</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
In this tutorial, we focus on movies and how we can make an app with React that allows a user to search through movies. The app is fairly simple in that it has a search bar, search results and a popup search result. The useState hook was used within the parent component. This helped us when scoping the state that would be used in children components. Each event was then made in the parent component as well and passed down to the respective child component.

The app is using the <a href="http://www.omdbapi.com/">OMDb API</a>. This API is a RESTful API to obtain movie information, all content, images, etc. You will need an API key in order for you to access the API. You can go through their process for procuring an API Key and inputting it into your app.
