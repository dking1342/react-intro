<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This is a weather application showing the current weather conditions and temperature for a location of the users' choosing. The app was made with React and the Open Weather API.
</p>
<p>
The background image styling will change depending on the location's temperature. If it is above 60 degress F then it will show a 'warm' background. Conversely, if it is below 60 degrees F then it will show a 'cool' background. 
</p>
<p>
The date, time, etc. has also been made so that it will show the respective date, time, etc. for the location that is entered. This was done by converting to the UTC and then adjusting it based on the time zone property from the API.
