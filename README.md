<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
In this exercise we built a menu. In the app there was some vanilla Javascript features and some more React new lessons. 
</p>
<p>
The incoming dataset was an object of all the menu items. The vanilla Javascript logic was to map through the menu items to identify all the categories. To eliminate any duplicate menu categories the <code>new Set</code> was used.
</p>
<p>
The new React lesson was how to filter through a piece of state and have the user interface display the dynamic differences. In this case it was a matter of sorting through the aforementioned array of categories. This was used to make buttons specifically for the categories instead of hard coding the categories and having it by out of sync with the dataset.
