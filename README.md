<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
In this exercise quite a few React lessons were learned. The slider is a typical image slider, but in this exercise it was done by adding dynamic logic for the css classes and using the useEffect hook to move through the slides and also to create an automatic slide after a set interval.
