<h2>Overview</h2>

This react project had a few useful techniques in a basic format. The first is the react-icon package which can be used to showcase icons in your app. Typically, I would use Font Awesome explicitly and add a CDN in the html head tag. However, by using the react-icons package you can access the icons and add them as a component. That can be pretty useful. Styling can be done as needed.

The other technique in this app is not exclusive to React. The app is basically an array slider. It has many of the same features as an image slider. The project had a local file to store the data. It was then destructured in the component and treated as a complete set of data that can be scrolled through. The function that checks the current, next and previous array index is a staple of how a user can go through a stack of data.
