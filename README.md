<h1>Navbar</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
In this exercise a navbar component was made and showcases some important features that are helpful when using with different sized screens. Apart from the typical hooks, format and process used in previous tutorials in this one a new hook was demonstrated: useRef hook.
</p>
<p>
The useRef hook is returns a mutable ref object whose .current property is initialized to the passed argument. The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component. 
</p>
<p>
I like to think of the useRef hook as a DOM selector in vanilla Javascript. It will allow the dev to select certain DOM element within the JSX and get and/or set attributes or values pertinent to the DOM element.
