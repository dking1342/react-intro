<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This is an application that helps a person look up recipes for the food they would like to cook and eat. The app uses React and also a food API called <a href="">Edamam</a>. This is a great app that helps you a developer take their data to make a nice user interface. You will need to sign up to make an account. This is needed to receive an ID and Key.

There is no styling in this app, and might be added at a later point in time.
