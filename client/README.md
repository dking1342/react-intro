<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This tutorial had two parts with the goal of creating an expense tracker which would tally all incoming and outgoing money. The first part consisted of making the front end with React. The second part was connecting the front end to a back end database where the data of expenses and income would persist.

The main points of learning had to do with React and the Context API. State is data within React components. They are the building blocks of how React components are dynamic and react to the user interacting with each component. Without the state persisting, the application will have pitfalls where the user will need to repeat past activities. The Context API helps store the state for all the components on the front end. Whereby the state is then connected to a backend database. In this case MongoDB was used with middleware and server connectivity via Node and Express. When completed, this can be considered a full stack app as it goes from front to back.
